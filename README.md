# PaRappa the Rapper 2 Decompilation

We are currently targeting the July 12th NTSC-J prototype, but we aim to target the final NTSC-J/NTSC/PAL builds in the foreseeable future.

### Requirements setup
1. `sudo apt install gcc-mipsel-linux-gnu binutils-mips-linux-gnu ninja-build`
2. `sudo apt install python3-pip`
3. `python3 -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt`

*Note: For compiling, you need to add the `i386` architecture. For instructions on that please check out [this guide](https://askubuntu.com/questions/454253/how-to-run-32-bit-app-in-ubuntu-64-bit) if you're on Ubuntu.*

### Setup

1. Create a folder named `iso` in the root of the repo.
2. Extract `SCPS_150.17` from an ISO of the July 12th prototype and place it in said `iso` folder.
3. `./configure.py` (use `-c` to do a clean split)
4. Execute the following command: `grep -rlE '%(gp_rel)' asm/nonmatchings/* | xargs sed -i -E -s 's/%(gp_rel)\(([^)]+)\)\(\$28\)/\2/' 2>/dev/null || true`
5. `ninja`

### asm-differ setup
1. After a successful build, create a folder named `expected`
2. Copy the `build` folder inside the `expected` folder.
3. `./tools/diff.py -mwo FUNCTION_NAME`

*Note: Every time you add a new symbol, you must do the asm-differ setup again.*
